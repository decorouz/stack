# stack

Important tseps to note in this implimentation:

We need to store the object in the stack in array(private array). This way the object in this array can't be access using their index. They can only be accessed using the push and pop method. We I guess are going to be a getter and setter method. 


Implimenting the private property, we use the WeakMap implimentation
